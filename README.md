# CoopVolcano Code of Conduct

Built from http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy.

## Executive Summary

CoopVolcano is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all CoopVolcano spaces both online and off. Anyone who
violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the
discretion of the Volcanologists team.

Some CoopVolcano spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly
available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these
rules.

Problem behavior may also be addressed at admin discretion. Do not try to justify
your behavior with the "technically I'm not breaking any rules" excuse. That will
not be acceptable here.

## Future Rule Changes

Adjustments and alterations to the rules may be proposed at any time. Discussion
should be respectful and logical. Whataboutisms, gaslighting, derailment, concern
trolling, etc. are not permitted as justification for rule changes.

## In Conclusion

You should be able to determine for yourself what is acceptable behavior and what
is not. Gaming should be a fun experience and a way for us to relax and forget
about the stress of life.

**DO NOT** turn this into a space that involves hostility or any behavior that may
make people feel unwelcome. Problem behavior will be addressed quickly and
respectfully.
